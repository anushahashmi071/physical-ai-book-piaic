# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook — an AI-native educational resource designed to teach embodied intelligence systems through simulation-first development. This comprehensive guide will take you from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced digital twin implementations for humanoid robots.

## About This Book

This textbook follows the core principles of **Physical AI**, emphasizing:
- **Embodied Intelligence**: AI systems operating in the physical world
- **Systems Thinking**: Understanding how concepts fit into larger architectures
- **Simulation-First**: Learning through virtual environments before hardware
- **Clarity Before Complexity**: Building intuition before diving into implementation details
- **Real-World Constraints**: Considering practical limitations and failure modes
- **Pedagogical Excellence**: Explaining the "why" before the "how"

## Learning Journey

### Module 1: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System
Begin your journey by understanding how robots communicate and coordinate through ROS 2, the Robot Operating System. You'll learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions — the fundamental building blocks that connect sensors, processors, and actuators in a distributed system.

### Module 2: Digital Twin - Gazebo & Unity
Advance to digital twin technologies where you'll master simulation environments using Gazebo for physics and sensor modeling, and Unity for visualization. Learn how to create virtual replicas of physical robots for safe, reproducible testing and development.

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter follows a consistent structure designed for optimal learning:
1. **Concept Overview**: What this is and why it matters
2. **Mental Model**: Analogies and system intuition
3. **System Architecture**: Components and data flow
4. **Minimal Example**: Illustrative code or pseudo-code
5. **Common Failure Modes**: What breaks in practice
6. **Industry Reality**: How this appears in real systems

## Target Audience

This book is designed for undergraduate and early-graduate students in Computer Science, AI, or Engineering. We assume basic Python knowledge but no prior robotics or ROS experience. By the end of this book, you will be able to conceptually design, simulate, and reason about humanoid robots controlled by AI agents operating in physical environments.

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational concepts of robotic communication systems, then progress to Module 2 where you'll apply these concepts in simulation environments. Each module builds upon the previous, creating a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI systems.
