```

## Response Text

Generated comprehensive tasks.md file for Module 2 (Digital Twin - Gazebo & Unity) with 7 phases covering:
- Setup tasks (directories, templates)
- Foundational tasks (core concepts)
- User Story 1: Digital Twin Fundamentals
- User Story 2: Gazebo Simulation Environment
- User Story 3: Unity Visualization and ROS 2 Integration
- User Story 4: Simulation-First Workflow and Integration
- Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

Tasks follow required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels, and file paths. Includes dependencies, parallel execution opportunities, and implementation strategy.

## Outcome

Successfully created a structured tasks.md file with 120 specific, actionable tasks organized by user stories and implementation phases for Module 2 of the Physical AI Book project.

## Evaluation

The tasks align with the feature specification, implementation plan, research findings, data model, and educational contracts. Each task is specific enough to be independently executable while contributing to the overall module objectives.
