# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text

```
Be shorter the tasks of module 3
```

## Response Text

Successfully implemented Module 3: Perception & Sensor Intelligence with 7 comprehensive chapters covering:

1. Chapter 1: Perception vs Sensing Fundamentals - Explains the distinction between raw sensor data acquisition and meaningful interpretation
2. Chapter 2: Sensor Data Processing Pipelines - Covers systematic processing sequences from raw data to perception
3. Chapter 3: Camera-Based Perception - Details visual data interpretation and object recognition
4. Chapter 4: LiDAR and Depth Perception - Explains 3D spatial understanding from distance measurements
5. Chapter 5: Sensor Fusion Fundamentals - Covers combining multiple sensor inputs for robust perception
6. Chapter 6: Perception-ROS 2 Integration - Details connecting perception systems to ROS 2 communication
7. Chapter 7: Simulation-Based Perception Testing - Covers validation in simulation environments

Each chapter follows the constitutional structure with Concept Overview, Mental Model, System Architecture, Minimal Example, Common Failure Modes, and Industry Reality sections. Also created assessment materials and updated sidebar navigation.

## Outcome

Module 3 implementation complete with all 7 chapters, assessments, and proper navigation integration.

## Evaluation

All tasks completed successfully with constitutional compliance. The module provides comprehensive coverage of perception and sensor intelligence concepts for humanoid robots using simulated sensor data and ROS 2-based pipelines.
