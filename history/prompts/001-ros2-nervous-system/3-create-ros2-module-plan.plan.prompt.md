# PHR: Create ROS2 module implementation plan

## User Input

```text
Module: 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Objective:
Define concise chapter-level structure for Module 1, simulation-first and RAG-ready.

Chapter Plan:

1. Robotic Nervous System

* Physical AI systems, sensors, actions
* Concept diagram

2. ROS 2 Overview

* Distributed framework, nodes, topics, services, actions
* Node-topic diagram

3. Nodes as Functional Units

* Responsibilities, lifecycle, AI mapping
* Node mapping diagram

4. Communication Patterns

* Topics vs services vs actions
* Comparison table

5. Python AI Agents with rclpy

* Integration of AI agents
* Minimal conceptual code

6. Robot Structure and URDF

* Links, joints, kinematics
* Simplified URDF diagram

7. System Integration

* Unified sensing, planning, action
* End-to-end system diagram

Assessment Mapping:

* Explain ROS 2 using analogy
* Draw ROS 2 humanoid architecture
* Identify communication mechanisms

Completion Criteria:

* Reason about ROS 2 without hardware
* Ready for Module 2 simulation
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). The plan includes technical context, constitution check alignment, project structure, implementation timeline across 3 phases (Research, Content Creation, Integration), and complexity tracking. The plan organizes the module into 7 chapters following the constitutional requirements with proper structure and assessment alignment.

## Outcome

Successfully created an implementation plan that aligns with project constitutional principles and provides a clear roadmap for developing the ROS 2 educational module.
