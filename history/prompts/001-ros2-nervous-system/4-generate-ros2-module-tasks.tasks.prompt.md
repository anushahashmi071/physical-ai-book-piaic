# PHR: Generate ROS2 module tasks

## User Input

```text
Be concise the tasks
```

## Response Summary

Generated comprehensive task list for the ROS 2 as Robotic Nervous System module following the constitutional requirements. Created 44 specific tasks organized into 7 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 5 user story-focused phases. Tasks follow the required format with proper IDs, parallelization markers [P], user story labels [US1-US3], and exact file paths. Organized by priority (P1-P3) with User Story 1 as MVP. Included dependencies, parallel execution examples, and implementation strategy.

## Outcome

Successfully created a detailed, executable task list that breaks down the ROS 2 educational module into specific, actionable items that follow constitutional principles and enable parallel development.
